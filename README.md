# Description
A simple application designed to host a pre-generated HTML file featuring a spatial map that illustrates the distribution of frog call captures across Australia for the FrogID project. This site is embedded within an iframe on the FrogID project's website, available at https://www.frogid.net.au/spatial-coverage. To facilitate easy updates to the spatial map HTML file, a dedicated repository and website have been established, as this functionality is not supported by Contentful.

## Updating map
1. Delete the existing `index.html` file and commit the changes.<br>
   a. Click on `code` and then click on `index.html`<br>
